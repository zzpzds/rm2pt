As a designer, I want to select and upload design drafts to platform, so that all design images are centralized
{
	Basic Flow {
		(User)1. the designer shall opens a file dialog and selects design image.
		(System)2. the platform shall validates file format.
		(System)3. the platform shall uploads image to database, generates thumbnail previews, and stores metadata.
	}
	Alternative Flow {
		A. At any time, Invalid file format detected :
			1. Displays an error message: "Unsupported file format. Please upload PNG, JPG, or SVG.".
		B. At any time, Upload failure :
			1. Alerts the user with "Upload failed. Please try again.".
		C. At any time, File exceeds 50MB limit :
			1. Shows "File size exceeds limit. Maximum allowed: 500MB.".
	}
}
As a developer, I want to review all design images and select a method to convert images to code
{
	Basic Flow {
		(System)1. The platform displays a paginated list of design images with thumbnails, metadata, and tags.	
		(System)2. The platform enables filtering/searching by tags, upload date, or designer ID.
		(User)3. The developer selects a design image.
		(System)4. The platform provides zoomable high-resolution previews for detailed inspection.
	}
	Alternative Flow {
		A. No design images available:
			1. Shows a placeholder message: "No designs found. Upload a design first."
	}
}
As a developer, I want to choose between AI-generated code or manual development for the selected design
{
	Basic Flow {
		(User)1. The developer selects a design image.
		(System)2. Prompts the developer to choose a conversion method:
			Option 1: AI Auto-Convert (platform generates code).
			Option 2: Manual Development (download design for manual work).
		(System)3. For AI mode, the platform allows specifying code preferences (e.g., React, HTML/CSS).
		(User)4. The developer selects the desired option.
	}
	Alternative Flow {
		A. AI service unavailable:
			1. Alerts "AI service is temporarily unavailable. Please try manual mode."
	}
}
As a developer, I want the platform to auto-convert the design into code via AI and provide downloadable results
{
	Basic Flow {
		(User)1. The developer selects "AI Auto-Convert".
		(System)2. Calls an AI conversion service and generates clean, annotated code.
		(System)3. Validates code integrity and packages it into a ZIP file.
		(System)4. Triggers a download and logs the activity.
	}
	Alternative Flow {
		A. Low AI confidence score (<90%):
			1. Warns "Conversion may require manual adjustments. Proceed?"
		B. Code validation errors:
			2. Highlights errors (e.g., unsupported elements) and offers retry options.
	}
}
As a developer, I want to download the design image for manual development if I prefer not to use AI
{
	Basic Flow {
		(User)1. The developer selects "Manual Development".
		(System)2. Provides the original design image as a downloadable file (PNG/JPG/SVG).
		(System)3. Auto-extracts design assets (e.g., icons, fonts) into a folder.
	}
	Alternative Flow {
		A. Image corruption detected:
			1. Alerts "Image file is corrupted. Please re-upload the design."
	}
}
